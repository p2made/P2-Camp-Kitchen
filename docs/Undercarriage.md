Made principally fromâ€¦

* 25x50 mm RHS
* 50x50 mm RHS

**NOTE:** While researching I have seen "receiver" used for the towbar mounting socket on the vehicle, & "shank tube" for the part that plugs into the receiver. I use the same terms here.

[![01 Under Frame & Base](Undercarriage/01-Under-Frame-Base.png)](Undercarriage/01-Under-Frame-Base.pdf "01 Under Frame & Base")

The design intention is for the bottom front rail of the box frame to be positioned directly above the front cross member of the base. 

## <a id="02"></a> Base

* The base mounts to the vehicle with the central tube serving as shank tube & going into the receiver.
* The length of the shank tube is drawn to go the full 130 mm depth of the receiver on my vehicle. Making it a few mm shorter may be desirable.
* Hole to suit 5/8" hitch pin needs to be positioned to suit the receiver on my vehicle & is not drawn.
